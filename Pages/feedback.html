                                    <p><em>Critique/Comments:</em>"Your website looks pretty good and I like the websites aesthetics. I like your use of artwork as background image for your website and how your navbar looks. Your website layout is very good and easy to navigate. One thing you could improve on is your usage of the footer because as of right now it is not very appealing and your "About Me" page is a better location for contact information however that's just my preference. I also don't like the way your "Assignments" page looks, the orange buttons don't really fit well with the aesthetics of your website however I don't know if they are placeholders or not. Overall, your website looks pretty good and I look forward to checking out the final version."
